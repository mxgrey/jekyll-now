## <a name="humanoids"></a>Humanoid Motion/Task Planning

Here we introduce the [Randomized Possibility Graph](/publications#rpg) (RPG) which provides a scalable approach to utilizing probabilistically complete planners on highly constrained platforms like humanoids. The RPG works by evaluating the *possibilities* of various routes before performing computationally expensive whole body inverse kinematics.

Here we generate motion plans for lifting large/heavy objects in the presence of obstacles. We introduce a parameter called the [Virtual Task Dimension](/publications#vtd) which allows the robot to plan out how it can avoid obstacles while shifting its weight to lift and release heavy objects.

## Miscellaneous Robot Videos

During the early stages of the DARPA Robotics Challenge, our lab had the pleasure of hosting [Matt Zucker](http://www.swarthmore.edu/NatSci/mzucker1/) during his spring break, and we got our HUBO2+ to walk from scratch in that week:

An unscripted video of me testing a simple whole body motion planner which can generate trajectories between user-defined waypoints while avoiding collisions and remaining balanced. The planner is based on CBiRRT.
