Thanks for stopping by! My name is Grey, and I'm a doctoral candidate at Georgia Tech who contributes to open-source software projects when time permits. Here you can find out about the research and software development that I've been up to.

## Research Topics

My recent research projects primarily revolve around [Humanoid Robotics](/gallery#humanoids) and [Motion Planning](/gallery#humanoids). More broadly, I'm fascinated by the dynamics of legged robots and [Locomanipulation Planning](/gallery#locomanipulation). I am also interested in developing high-performance [Teleoperation](/publications#teleop) frameworks suitable for highly dynamic robot platforms.

## Software Development

Lately my software development effort has been focused on [DART](http://dartsim.github.io/) (Dynamic Animation and Robotics Toolkit). In the past, I have also contributed to software systems for teleoperating the [HUBO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HUBO) research platform.

Ultimately, I'd like to help in developing open source software tools to enable advanced robotics research and to realize robotics systems that can exploit their dynamics while autonomously performing high-level tasks.

When developing software, I always aim to strike a careful balance between performance, safety, comprehensiveness, extensibility, maintainability, and user-friendliness.

## Contact me

If you have questions about my work or are interested in collaborating, I encourage you to contact me.

I also happen to be the in the [job market](mailto:greyxmike@gmail.com?subject=Job Inquiry) right now (aiming for a starting time around early-mid July), so please do contact me if you feel that I may fit what you're looking for.
